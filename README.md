# What is Asyncher?
Asyncher is a tool created with the intention of **simplifying** the lives of developers when they need to implement a **synchronization system** within their project.

It is designed to be able to function **independently** of the ecosystem it is in. **No matter which programming language. No matter which framework. No matter which database.** The only thing you have to do is an initial configuration.
